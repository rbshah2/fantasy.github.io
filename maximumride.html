<h1 class="Lobster"> ðŸ¦… Maximum Ride ðŸ¦…</h1>
			
			<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Maximum Ride is a mutant, rasied in a dog crate inside of a lab. She is an avian-american, 98% human and 2% bird. She trusts nobody besides her flock: Fang, Iggy, Gasman, Nudge, and Angel. 
				<br> <br>
				When they finally escaped from the lab, they lived in safety for four years but of course that cannot last. While on the run, Max uncovers a secret...she is destined to save the world. 
				</p>
